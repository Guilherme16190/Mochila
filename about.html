                <p>Backpacks are essential accessories that provide a convenient and practical way to carry personal items. With internal 
                    compartments and pockets, they make it easy to organize and access objects. What's more, when worn on the back, they 
                    distribute weight evenly, making transportation more comfortable and ergonomically correct. Their versatility makes them ideal 
                    for a variety of activities, from carrying school or work materials to using them on trips and outdoor adventures. Some backpacks
                     are designed to protect against adverse weather conditions and impacts, ensuring the safety of objects. They also play a role in 
                     fashion, with a wide variety of styles and designs available to suit personal preferences and complement the wearer's style. </p>

            <div class="texto4">
                <p>A typical backpack is made up of resistant fabric, zippers for access, adjustable straps, internal compartments,
                    protective lining, zippers, internal structure (in larger backpacks), padded back panel for comfort, side pockets, 
                    compression straps (in larger backpacks), and design elements such as logos and labels. The composition varies depending on 
                    the purpose of the backpack and can include specific features such as bottle pockets in everyday backpacks or a robust structure 
                    in trekking backpacks.</p>
